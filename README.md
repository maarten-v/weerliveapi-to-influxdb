# weerliveapi-to-influxdb
Fetch temperature and humidity from a Dutch location and put it in a Influxdb database

I use this together with Domoticz and Grafana.
I created a dummy sensor in Domoticz and put the idx of that new sensor in the python script.

Go to http://weerlive.nl/delen.php and get a API key.
Fill in all the variables in the top of the file
